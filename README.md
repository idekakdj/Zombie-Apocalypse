# Zombie-Apocalypse
Simulation Project
In an abandoned world taken over by zombies 1-3 survivors will select 3 items out of 6 choices to surivive waves of zombies as long as they can.
They will be in the middle of the game world and zombies will spawn all around.
There will be an hp bar and stats (score and wave#) at the top and there will be upgrade progress bars to show how close to an item upgrade.

# Zombie-Apocalypse by Paul, Cayden, Jayden, John
Simulation Project
In an abandoned world taken over by zombies that are mutated people who received radiation poisoning from a nuclear war, 1 of 3 survivors will be chosen with one weapon and two support items to survive waves of zombies as long as they can.
They will be in the middle of the game world and zombies will spawn all around.
Features:
- three different survivors with different hp and speed values
- boundary restricting survivor movement (can't move out too far due to high radiation)
- four types of zombies with different damage, speed, hp and hitboxes
- two different weapons, bat and gun with upgrades - sword and machine gun
- slashing animations for both the melee weapons
- hp bars, all zombies will have hp bars that follow them and update, survivors will have a larger hp bar at the top of the screen that reflect different hp values for each survivor
- score tracker, the score tracker will also be at the top of the screen and keep track of wave # and a score based on zombies killed where different types of zombies will have different score values
- upgrade progress bar, a bar at the bottom showing how close you are to a weapon upgrade (need 500 score to get upgrade which is reached after clearing wave 3)
- nighttime world effect that triggers in a day/night cycle
- random zombie spawns every simulation
- dialogue in starting world screens and both end screens
